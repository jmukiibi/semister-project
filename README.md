# semister-project
The goal of this project is to enable you study an existing code base, identify abstrac- tions (data, &amp; procedure abstractions) and build new abstractions for a given problem do- main. You will explore Data Science abstractions for Scheme - https://github.com/n3mo/ data-science. The purpose of the abstractions is to allow developers to write data analytics and manipulation software in a language that does not natively provide the support. In this case the language is Scheme.
